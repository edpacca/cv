    notes:
      - note: Hit the ground running and had to quickly learn new technologies in order to begin contributing to the codebase.
        skills:
          - Ubuntu
          - Python
          - Django
          - Svelte
          - PyQt
      - note: Assigned a solo project to rebuild the entire frontend for the 'In Theatre GUI' in Svelte. This is a complex browser application used by surgeons during operations. This was challenging as it was initially written in pure JS/TS targetting a Django web-app, using websockets and a complex Redux store to manage state. A highlight was figuring out how to wrap the Redux store in a way that exposed state based variables to make use of the Svelte store api. I am proud of this work and it demonstrates my ability to rapidly learn someting new and become an effective contributer. I learned an entirely new codebase, and re-implemented it in a programming framework which was relatively new to me at the time.
