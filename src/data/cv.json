Had to fully read and understand the existing application which used Redux to manage complex state dependent transitions, and websockets to send and recieve processed data from cloud based GPUs severs. A key challenge was figuring out how to expose and connect the Redux store to the Svelte store so Svelte components could subscribe to state changes. I architected and structured the entire JS/TS component library and rebuilt the product from the ground up. The result is a highly extensible, readable and testable codebase; the application is a medical device and is used by surgeons during operations to save lives."
